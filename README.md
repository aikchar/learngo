# Lean Go with Examples

I'm learning Go and writing about it here: https://aikchar.dev/blog/learn-go-with-examples.

This repo follows the blog post, which has multiple checkpoints. Each
checkpoint has a corresponding branch in this repo. As you follow along the
post you can checkout the checkpoint branch and inspect it.
